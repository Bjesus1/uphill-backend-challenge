# Uphill backend challenge

### How to run

1. Go to the root folder of the project
2. cd /out/artifacts/backend_challenge_jar
3. run java -jar backend.challenge.jar

### Known issues 

Sometimes, while executing the client, phase 5 may fail due to connection errors and/or phase 6 as well with results differing in terms of value from what is expected.
Please, re-run the test again, as this may be related to the lost of active connections (needs further exploration over the TCP Connection retries mechanism).
